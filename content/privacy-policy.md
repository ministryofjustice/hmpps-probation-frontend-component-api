# Privacy policy for Probation Digital Services

Last reviewed: 30 May 2025

Probation Digital Services is provided by Justice Digital, part of the Ministry of Justice.

The Ministry of Justice is the data controller. A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is committed to the protection and security of your personal information. It is important that you read this notice so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information. This privacy policy describes how we collect and use personal information during and after your relationship with us, in accordance with data protection law. It will be updated regularly.

## About personal information

This privacy policy sets out the standards that you can expect from the Ministry of Justice when we request or hold personal information ('personal data') about you; how you can get access to a copy of your personal data; and what you can do if you think the standards are not being met.

Personal data is information about you as an individual. It can be your name and email address.

We know how important it is to protect your privacy and to comply with data protection laws. We will safeguard your personal data and will only disclose it where it is lawful to do so, or with your consent.

## What data we collect

The personal data we collect from you includes:

* your username, password, name and email address
* your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of web browser you used
* information on how you use the site, using cookies, page tagging techniques, monitoring and logging, and auditing services

We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use the sites on Probation Digital Services. This includes IP addresses. The data is anonymised before being used for analytics processing.

Google Analytics processes anonymised information about:

* the pages you visit
* how long you spend on each page
* how you got to the site
* what you click on while you’re visiting the site

We do not store your personal information (for example, your name or address) through Google Analytics.

We will not identify you through analytics information, and we will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would identify who you are.

We use an internal auditing service to ensure that your use of the service is in line with Information Security policies, and to aid investigations into potential breaches. This service records what pages you view, and the actions you perform while using Probation Digital Services.

We use monitoring and logging services to ensure the technical performance of the service is adequate. These services record which parts of Probation Digital Services you access.

We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they're effective and to detect any weaknesses.

## Why we need your data

We collect information through Google Analytics to see how you use the service. We do this to help:

* make sure the service is meeting the needs of its users
* make improvements, for example improving site search

We also collect data in order to:

* confirm you can lawfully access and alter data on the service
* confirm your use of the service is in line with information security policy
* gather feedback to improve our services
* respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to
* monitor use of the site to identify security threats
* Ensure the technical performance of the site is adequate

## Our legal basis for processing your data

The legal basis for processing personal data in relation to site security is our legitimate interests, and the legitimate interests of our users, in ensuring the security and integrity of Probation Digital Services.

The legal basis for processing all other personal data is that it is collected to fulfil your obligations under your employment contract, and it is necessary to perform a task in line with HMPPS policies and procedures.

## What we do with your data

We will not:

* sell or rent your data to third parties
* share your data with third parties for marketing purposes
* use your data in analytics

We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

## Comments and feedback

If you comment or give feedback, we use your email data to check you are authorised to use Probation Digital Services.

## How long we keep your data

We will only retain your personal data for as long as:

* it is needed for the purposes set out in this document

## Where your data is processed and stored

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it's processed and when it's stored.

All personal data is stored in the European Economic Area (EEA). Data collected by Google Analytics data may be transferred outside the EEA for processing.

## How we protect your data and keep it secure

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.

We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.
