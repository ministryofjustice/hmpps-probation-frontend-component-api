## Technical information about this service’s accessibility

HMPPS Digital Services is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This service is partially compliant with [the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Non accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

1. PDFs and other documents are not accessible in a number of ways including missing text alternatives and missing document structure. This fails [WCAG 1.1.1 A (Non-text Content)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) and [WCAG 2.4.2 A (Page Titled)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#page-titled). These documents are automatically extracted from an external service (NDelius). We are assessing how to fix this issue and when it may be fixed by.

1. The headings in the risk register and the orders list are not presented in a logical order for screen readers, this fails [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships). We are working on fixing this and it should be solved by August 2022.

1. Some of the page titles in the service are not descriptive of the purpose of the page. They are also duplicated in some cases. This fails [WCAG 2.4.2 Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#page-titled). We are working on fixing this and it should be solved by August 2022.

1. The visual date labels in the date picker do not match the accessible names. This fails [WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#label-in-name).We are working on fixing this and it should be solved by August 2022.

1. When the case list is filtered, the visual design shows an ‘x’ in the corner of each added filter that can be used to remove that filter. This isn’t reflected in the accessible label so there is no easy way to remove filters for screen reader users. This fails [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships) and [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels). We are working on fixing this and it should be solved by August 2022.

Any required changes will be planned into our continuous improvement work for this service.
