# Accessibility statement for Create and vary a licence

Last reviewed: 19 August 2022

This accessibility statement applies to the Create and vary a licence service, available at [https://create-and-vary-a-licence.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/](https://create-and-vary-a-licence.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/).

Create and vary a licence is run by HMPPS Digital Services. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. That means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen

- get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard

- listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device (laptop, phone) easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this service is

We know some parts of this service are not fully accessible:

- Some parts of forms are not grouped together programmatically. This means the question being asked can appear separate to the box where the information can be entered for screen reader users

- Some text used to describe information requested on forms is not clear enough, which can cause issues for screen readers

- Some pages are not properly formatted with a clear layout and structure, making them harder for screen reader users to navigate

- Links are not descriptive enough to allow screen reader users to determine where they go

- Several page titles do not adequately describe what is on the pages

- Some pages are missing labels that allow parts of them to be selected using speech recognition software

- There are several issues with the PDF licence document created by the service. For example, it is missing tags that tell screen readers what kind of information is present

## Feedback and contact information

We are always looking to improve our service, including its accessibility. If you find any problems that are not listed on this page or think we are not meeting accessibility requirements, email: [createandvaryalicence@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:createandvaryalicence@digital.justice.gov.uk)

## Technical information about accessibility in this service

HMPPS Digital Services is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This service is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. We plan to address these issues as part of our ongoing work to improve the service.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- Form elements have not been grouped together with clear fieldsets and legends, making it hard for screen readers to determine what is being requested. This does not meet WCAG 1.3.1 Info and relationships and WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or instructions

- Some attributes do not provide screen readers with enough descriptive information to be able to answer questions correctly. This does not meet WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or instructions

- Some pages only use one type of heading, making the structure harder to understand. This does not meet WCAG 1.3.1 Info and relationships

- The same page title is used across several screens, which means it is harder for screen readers to distinguish between them. This does not meet WCAG 2.4.2 Page titled

- Labels that allow users of speech recognition software to navigate pages are missing. This does not meet WCAG 2.5.3 Label in name

- The PDF licence document created by the service is difficult for screen readers to navigate because page elements such as headings, images and lists are not properly labelled. This does not meet WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text content and WCAG 1.3.1 Info and relationships

## What we are doing to improve accessibility

We will continue to do internal audits to check the accessibility of this service, as well as taking feedback from users.

Any required changes will be planned into our ongoing work on this service.

This accessibility statement will be updated based on any issues we identify or any changes we make to address any issues.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 19 August 2022.

This service was last tested on 4 February 2022 by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC).

DAC carried out a full WCAG 2.1 AA level audit of the main user journeys. This included extensive testing by users with a wide range of disabilities.
