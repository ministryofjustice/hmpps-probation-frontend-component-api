This accessibility statement applies to the Consider a recall service, available at [make-recall-decision.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk](http://make-recall-decision.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/).

This website is run by HMPPS Digital Services. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. You should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen

- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard

- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software

- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

Parts of this website are not fully accessible. For example:

- the presentation and layout of the content on one page might cause you to miss the information

- there are multiple regions that are referenced by the same label which might cause problems if you’re using assistive technology

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

HMPPS Digital Services is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

1. On the Case Summary Overview page, there are multiple regions that are referenced by the same label (‘Important’). This can pose problems to assistive technology users. With multiple regions using the same landmark, users won’t be able to identify the purpose of each one. This makes it harder for them to navigate quickly to the information they want to see. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 4.1.1 (Parsing). We plan to fix this by April 2024.

## Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

### PDFs and other documents

Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By April 2024, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.

The accessibility regulations [do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made) if they’re not essential to providing our services.

Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
