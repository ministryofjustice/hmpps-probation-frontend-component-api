# Accessibility statement for Workload Measurement Tool (WMT)

Last reviewed: 16 May 2022

This accessibility statement applies to the Workload Measurement Tool (WMT), a caseload allocation service used by the Probation service to allocate people on probation to a probation practitioner.

This service is run by HMPPS Digital Services. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means that (with the exception of the graph) you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen navigate most of the website using just a keyboard

- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software

- listen to most of the website using a screen reader

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

HMPPS Digital Services is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.

## What we’ve done to improve accessibility

This service was tested in May 2022, and the audit identified a number of accessibility issues. These have all been fixed, except the accessibility issues with a third-party graph.

### Non-compliant third-party graph

The service has a third-party graph that is not readable by screen readers. Keyboard users would require the use of a mouse to navigate, and voice activation users cannot access the graph. Poor contrast between colours in both text and non-text elements makes the graph difficult to read for low vision users.

We were unable to update the third-party graph, so we’ve added an accessible table that contains the same data. This allows users of assistive technology to access the information displayed by the graph.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 15 May 2023.

This website was last tested on 16 May 2022. The test was carried out by [Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/).
