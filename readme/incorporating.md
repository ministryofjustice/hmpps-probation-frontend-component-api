# Using the NPM package.

The easiest way to incorporate the components into your application is to use the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-frontend-components).

Instructions can be found in that project's readme file.

Using the NPM package is the preferred method of implementation, but if you cannot do this you can [incorporate the components manually](incorporating_manually.md). Please discuss your requirements in the #probation-connected-services Slack channel first.
